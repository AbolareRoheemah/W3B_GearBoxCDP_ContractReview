### 1.5 Overview of CDPVault
This contract implements a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) vault system. A CDP is a system that allows users to lock up collateral (some form of asset) and borrow against it. The **CDPVault** contract is designed to facilitate borrowing against collateral deposits, enabling users to draw credit while managing their collateralized positions effectively. The contract includes mechanisms for liquidating positions when the collateral value drops below a required threshold, features such as interest accrual, and access control to ensure secure operations.


### 1.8 System Overview
The CDPVault interacts with various components such as oracles for price feeds, incentive controllers for reward distribution, and utilizes OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for permission management.

## 2. CONTRACT REVIEW

### Contract Structure:
- **Imports**: The contract imports necessary libraries listed below:
```bash
import {AccessControl} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";
```
- #### DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE

  - Highest level access
  - Can manage other roles
  - Set during initialization

- #### VAULT_CONFIG_ROLE

  - Can modify vault parameters:

    - Debt floor
    - Liquidation ratio
    - Liquidation penalty
    - Liquidation discount
    - Reward controller address

- #### PAUSER_ROLE

  - Can pause/unpause vault operations
  - Emergency control mechanism

- #### VAULT_UNWINDER_ROLE

```bash
import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
```
The IERC20 interface is used in the CDPVault contract to interact with ERC20 tokens used like the collateral tokens and poolUnderlying token.
```bash
import {SafeERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
```
This line imports the SafeERC20 library from OpenZeppelin. This library is essential for interacting with ERC20 tokens in a secure and reliable way.
```bash
import {ICDPVaultBase, CDPVaultConstants, CDPVaultConfig} from "./interfaces/ICDPVault.sol";
```
This line imports three elements from the ICDPVault.sol file located in the ./interfaces directory:
`ICDPVaultBase`: The interface that defines the basic functions and properties that any CDPVault contract must implement (pool, oracle, token,tokenScale, vaultConfig, totalDebt, position, deposit, withdraw, spotPrice and modifyCollateralAndDebt). By inheriting from this interface, the CDPVault contract ensures it adheres to a standardized set of functionalities. This makes it easier for other contracts to interact with the CDPVault contract in a predictable way.
`CDPVaultConstants`: This is a struct that defines the constants used by the CDPVault contract. This struct contains values like the address of the pool, the address of the oracle, address of the collateral token, and the tokenScale. By importing this struct, the CDPVault contract can access these constants directly.
`CDPVaultConfig`: This is another struct that defines the configuration parameters for the CDPVault contract. This struct contains values like the debt floor, the liquidation ratio, the liquidation penalty, the liquidatio discount and the addresses of the various administrators. By importing this struct, the CDPVault contract can access these configuration parameters directly.
```bash
import {IOracle} from "./interfaces/IOracle.sol";
```
This line imports the IOracle interface from the ./interfaces/IOracle.sol file. This interface defines the functions and properties that any oracle contract must implement to be compatible with the CDPVault contract. This includes:
`spot(address token)`: This function returns the current spot price of a given token.
`getStatus(address token)`: This function checks the status of the price feed of the token.
```bash
import {WAD, toInt256, toUint64, max, min, add, sub, wmul, wdiv, wmulUp, abs} from "./utils/Math.sol";
```
This line imports a set of mathematical functions and constants from the ./utils/Math.sol file. These functions and constants are used throughout the CDPVault contract for various calculations and operations. Below is a breakdown of the imported elements:
1. **`WAD`:** This constant represents the base unit for calculations involving WADs (Whole-Number-Adjusted Decimal). It's typically set to 1e18, representing 18 decimal places. This constant is used for scaling and precision in calculations involving decimal values.
2. **`toInt256(uint256 value)`:** This function converts a `uint256` value to an `int256` value. This is useful for performing calculations that involve both positive and negative values.
3. **`toUint64(uint256 value)`:** This function converts a `uint256` value to a `uint64` value. This is useful for storing values in storage variables that have a limited size.
4. **`max(uint256 a, uint256 b)`:** This function returns the larger of two `uint256` values.
5. **`min(uint256 a, uint256 b)`:** This function returns the smaller of two `uint256` values.
6. **`add(uint256 a, uint256 b)`:** This function adds two `uint256` values.
7. **`sub(uint256 a, uint256 b)`:** This function subtracts two `uint256` values.
8. **`wmul(uint256 a, uint256 b)`:** This function multiplies two `uint256` values, scaling the result by the `WAD` constant. This is useful for performing calculations involving decimal values.
9. **`wdiv(uint256 a, uint256 b)`:** This function divides two `uint256` values, scaling the result by the `WAD` constant. This is useful for performing calculations involving decimal values.
10. **`wmulUp(uint256 a, uint256 b)`:** This function multiplies two `uint256` values, scaling the result by the `WAD` constant and rounding up to the nearest integer. This is useful for performing calculations involving decimal values where rounding up is required.
11. **`abs(int256 value)`:** This function returns the absolute value of an `int256` value.
```bash
import {Permission} from "./utils/Permission.sol";
```
This line imports the `Permission` library from the `./utils/Permission.sol` file. This library provides functionalities for managing permissions and access control within the `CDPVault` contract. It inherits the IPermission interface which consist of 3 function declarations (i.e., hasPermission(address owner, address caller), modifyPermission(address caller, bool allowed) and modifyPermission(address owner, address caller, bool allowed)). 
This library is crucial for the `CDPVault` contract to ensure that only authorized parties can interact with its functionalities, enhancing its security and preventing unauthorized access. 
```bash
import {Pause, PAUSER_ROLE} from "./utils/Pause.sol";
```
This line imports the Pause library and the PAUSER_ROLE constant from the ./utils/Pause.sol file. This library provides functionalities for pausing and unpausing the CDPVault contract, allowing for temporary suspension of its operations. The Pause library inherits 3 other contracts/libraries: The Openzeppelin AccessControl and Pausable libraries, and IPause interface which consist of 3 functions (i.e., pausedAt, paused and unpause).
```bash
import {IChefIncentivesController} from "./reward/interfaces/IChefIncentivesController.sol";
```
This line imports the `IChefIncentivesController` interface from the `./reward/interfaces/IChefIncentivesController.sol` file. This interface defines the functions and properties that any reward controller contract must implement to be compatible with the `CDPVault` contract. These functions include:
- `handleActionAfter(address user, uint256 debt, uint256 totalDebt)`: This function is called after a user modifies their position (e.g., borrows, repays, deposits, withdraws). It allows the reward controller to update its internal state based on the user's actions and the overall debt of the vault.
- Other functions related to reward distribution, such as claiming rewards, updating reward rates, or tracking reward balances.
```bash
import {IPoolV3} from "@gearbox-protocol/core-v3/contracts/interfaces/IPoolV3.sol";
```
This line imports the `IPoolV3` interface from the Gearbox Protocol's core-v3 library. This interface defines the functions and properties that any Gearbox Pool v3 contract must implement. These functions include:
- `underlyingToken()`: Returns the address of the underlying token used by the pool.
- `baseInterestIndex()`: Returns the current base interest index of the pool.
- `lendCreditAccount(uint256 amount, address creditor)`: Lends credit to a creditor account.
- `repayCreditAccount(uint256 amount, uint256 profit, uint256 fees)`: Repays credit from a creditor account.
- `updateQuotaRevenue(int256 quotaRevenueChange)`: Updates the quota revenue of the pool.
- Other functions related to managing credit accounts, interest rates, and other pool operations.
By importing the `IPoolV3` interface, the `CDPVault` contract ensures that it can interact with any Gearbox Pool v3 contract. This allows for seamless integration with the Gearbox Protocol.
```bash
import {SafeCast} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol";
```
Solidity's integer types have a limited range. When performing operations that could result in values exceeding this range, overflow or underflow can occur, leading to unexpected and potentially harmful results. The `SafeCast` library helps prevent these issues by providing functions that check for potential overflow and underflow before performing the conversion. It provides functions like `safeCast`, `safeCastToUint256`, `safeCastToInt256`, and others. These functions take an integer value of one type and attempt to convert it to another type. If the conversion is safe (i.e., no overflow or underflow), the function returns the converted value. Otherwise, it reverts the transaction, preventing potential errors. By using the `SafeCast` library, the `CDPVault` contract can significantly improve its security and reliability. It ensures that all integer conversions are performed safely, preventing potential errors and vulnerabilities that could arise from overflow or underflow.
```bash
import {CreditLogic} from "@gearbox-protocol/core-v3/contracts/libraries/CreditLogic.sol";
```
This line imports the `CreditLogic` library from the Gearbox Protocol's core-v3 library. This library provides functionalities for managing credit accounts and performing calculations related to credit operations within the Gearbox Protocol. The `CreditLogic` library provides functions for:
- **Creating credit accounts:** Initializing new credit accounts for users.
- **Updating credit balances:** Adjusting credit balances based on lending and borrowing operations.
- **Calculating interest accrual:** Determining the amount of interest accrued on credit accounts.
- **Managing credit limits:** Enforcing credit limits for users.
- **Calculating credit increases:** Determining the new credit balance after a user borrows additional credit.
- **Calculating credit decreases:** Determining the new credit balance after a user repays some of their credit.
- **Calculating interest rates:** Determining the applicable interest rate for credit accounts.
This import statement is crucial for the `CDPVault` contract to function as a borrow vault, enabling users to borrow credit against their deposited collateral using the Gearbox Protocol's credit management system. 
```bash
import {QuotasLogic} from "@gearbox-protocol/core-v3/contracts/libraries/QuotasLogic.sol";
```
This line imports the `QuotasLogic` library from the Gearbox Protocol's core-v3 library. This library provides functionalities for managing quotas and performing calculations related to quotas within the Gearbox Protocol. The `QuotasLogic` library provides functions for:
- **Setting quotas:** Defining the maximum amount of credit that can be borrowed against a specific asset or pool.
- **Updating quotas:** Adjusting quotas based on market conditions or other factors.
- **Checking quotas:** Verifying if a user's borrowing request is within the current quota limits.
- **Calculating available quota:** Determining the remaining quota available for borrowing.
- **Calculating quota utilization:** Determining the percentage of quota that has been used.
- **Calculating quota impact:** Determining the impact of a borrowing request on the overall quota utilization.
```bash
import {IPoolQuotaKeeperV3} from "@gearbox-protocol/core-v3/contracts/interfaces/IPoolQuotaKeeperV3.sol";
```
This line imports the `IPoolQuotaKeeperV3` interface from the Gearbox Protocol's core-v3 library. This interface defines the functions and properties that any Gearbox Pool Quota Keeper v3 contract must implement. These functions include:
- `updateQuotaRevenue(int256 quotaRevenueChange)`: Updates the quota revenue of the pool.
- `getQuotaRevenue()` : Returns the current quota revenue of the pool.
- `getQuotaRevenuePerToken(address token)`: Returns the current quota revenue per token of the pool.
- `getQuotaRevenuePerToken(address token, uint256 timestamp)`: Returns the quota revenue per token of the pool at a specific timestamp.
- Other functions related to managing quota revenue, such as tracking quota revenue changes and calculating quota revenue per token.
This import statement is crucial for the `CDPVault` contract to ensure that borrowing operations are within the defined quota limits, preventing excessive borrowing and maintaining the stability of the Gearbox Protocol. 

- **Interface**
```bash
interface IPoolV3Loop is IPoolV3 {
    function mintProfit(uint256 profit) external;

    function enter(address user, uint256 amount) external;

    function exit(address user, uint256 amount) external;

    function addAvailable(address user, int256 amount) external;
}
```
This defines a custom interface `IPoolV3Loop` that extends the `IPoolV3` interface from the Gearbox Protocol. It essentially adds four new functions to the standard `IPoolV3` interface:
1. **`mintProfit(uint256 profit) external`:** This function allows the `CDPVault` contract to mint profit into the Gearbox Pool. This is used to distribute accrued interest from the vault to the pool's liquidity providers.
2. **`enter(address user, uint256 amount) external`:** This function allows the `CDPVault` contract to deposit funds into the Gearbox Pool on behalf of a user. This is used when a user deposits collateral into the vault, and the vault needs to deposit those funds into the pool to generate credit.
3. **`exit(address user, uint256 amount) external`:** This function allows the `CDPVault` contract to withdraw funds from the Gearbox Pool on behalf of a user.
4. **`addAvailable(address user, int256 amount) external`:** This function allows the `CDPVault` contract to adjust the available balance of a user's credit account within the Gearbox Pool.

### State Variables: Includes parameters for collateral management, debt tracking, liquidation configurations, and user positions.
```bash
bytes32 constant VAULT_CONFIG_ROLE = keccak256("VAULT_CONFIG_ROLE");
bytes32 constant VAULT_UNWINDER_ROLE = keccak256("VAULT_UNWINDER_ROLE");
IOracle public immutable oracle;
IERC20 public immutable token;
uint256 public immutable tokenScale;
uint256 constant INDEX_PRECISION = 10 ** 9;
IPoolV3 public immutable pool;
IERC20 public immutable poolUnderlying;
VaultConfig public vaultConfig;
uint256 public totalDebt;
LiquidationConfig public liquidationConfig;
IChefIncentivesController public rewardController;
```
`VAULT_CONFIG_ROLE`, `VAULT_UNWINDER_ROLE`: Used for permissions, enabling certain addresses to change configurations or perform specific actions.
`oracle`: Provides current pricing for the collateral.
`token`: Represents the collateral ERC20 token.
`tokenScale`: A scaling factor based on the token's decimals.
`pool` and `poolUnderlying`: Interact with a liquidity pool for handling funds.
`vaultConfig`: Vault configuration variable.
`totalDebt`: Tracks the total backed debt across all positions.
`liquidationConfig`: Configuration for liquidation of position.
`rewardController`: Address that controls reward incentives.

- **Events**: Emits events for significant actions like modifying positions, liquidations, and parameter updates.
```bash
event ModifyPosition(address indexed position, uint256 debt, uint256 collateral, uint256 totalDebt);
event ModifyCollateralAndDebt(
    address indexed position,
    address indexed collateralizer,
    address indexed creditor,
    int256 deltaCollateral,
    int256 deltaDebt
);
event SetParameter(bytes32 indexed parameter, uint256 data);
event SetParameter(bytes32 indexed parameter, address data);
event LiquidatePosition(
    address indexed position,
    uint256 collateralReleased,
    uint256 normalDebtRepaid,
    address indexed liquidator
);
event VaultCreated(address indexed vault, address indexed token, address indexed owner);
```

### Key Data Structures:
```bash
struct VaultConfig {
    uint128 debtFloor;
    uint64 liquidationRatio;
}
```
This struct defines basic configuration parameters:
`debtFloor`: Minimum amount of debt a position must have (prevents dust positions)
`liquidationRatio`: The threshold at which a position becomes unsafe and can be liquidated

```bash
struct DebtData {
    uint256 debt;
    uint256 cumulativeIndexNow;
    uint256 cumulativeIndexLastUpdate;
    uint128 cumulativeQuotaInterest;
    uint192 cumulativeQuotaIndexNow;
    uint192 cumulativeQuotaIndexLU;
    uint256 accruedInterest;
    //   uint256 accruedFees;
}
```
This struct handles debt calculations:
- Tracks current debt
- Tracks various interest rate accumulators
- Calculates accrued interest

```bash
struct Position {
    uint256 collateral;
    uint256 debt;
    uint256 lastDebtUpdate;
    uint256 cumulativeIndexLastUpdate;
    uint192 cumulativeQuotaIndexLU;
    uint128 cumulativeQuotaInterest;
}
```
This represents an individual CDP position:
`collateral`: Amount of collateral locked
`debt`: Amount of debt taken
`lastDebtUpdate`: When the debt was last modified
`cumulativeIndexLastUpdate`: Interest rate accumulator at last update
`cumulativeQuotaIndexLU`: Quota-related interest accumulator
`cumulativeQuotaInterest`: Accumulated interest from quotas

```bash
struct LiquidationConfig {
    uint64 liquidationPenalty;
    uint64 liquidationDiscount;
}
```
Controls liquidation parameters:
`liquidationPenalty`: Extra cost imposed on liquidated positions
`liquidationDiscount`: Discount given to liquidators as incentive

### Custom Errors: Includes error messages for various unauthorized or unexpected behaviours in the contract.
```bash
error CDPVault__modifyPosition_debtFloor();
error CDPVault__modifyCollateralAndDebt_notSafe();
error CDPVault__modifyCollateralAndDebt_noPermission();
error CDPVault__modifyCollateralAndDebt_maxUtilizationRatio();
error CDPVault__setParameter_unrecognizedParameter();
error CDPVault__liquidatePosition_notUnsafe();
error CDPVault__liquidatePosition_invalidSpotPrice();
error CDPVault__liquidatePosition_invalidParameters();
error CDPVault__noBadDebt();
error CDPVault__BadDebt();
error CDPVault__repayAmountNotEnough();
error CDPVault__tooHighRepayAmount();
```

### Key Functions:
- **Constructor**: Initializes the vault with essential parameters such as oracle address, token details, debt floor, liquidation ratio, etc.
```bash
constructor(CDPVaultConstants memory constants, CDPVaultConfig memory config) {
    pool = constants.pool;
    oracle = constants.oracle;
    token = constants.token;
    tokenScale = constants.tokenScale;

    poolUnderlying = IERC20(pool.underlyingToken());

    vaultConfig = VaultConfig({debtFloor: config.debtFloor, liquidationRatio: config.liquidationRatio});

    liquidationConfig = LiquidationConfig({
        liquidationPenalty: config.liquidationPenalty,
        liquidationDiscount: config.liquidationDiscount
    });

    // Access Control Role Admin
    _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, config.roleAdmin);
    _grantRole(VAULT_CONFIG_ROLE, config.vaultAdmin);
    _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, config.pauseAdmin);

    emit VaultCreated(address(this), address(token), config.roleAdmin);
}
```
The constructor:

- Takes two configuration objects
- Initializes immutable variables
- Sets up initial configuration
- Grants administrative roles

- **SetParameter**: An overloaded function used to configure vault parameters like liquidationRatio, liquidationPenalty, liquidationDiscount and rewardController depending on the arguments passed. It emits the `SetParameter` event.
```bash
function setParameter(bytes32 parameter, uint256 data) external whenNotPaused onlyRole(VAULT_CONFIG_ROLE) {
    if (parameter == "debtFloor") vaultConfig.debtFloor = uint128(data);
    else if (parameter == "liquidationRatio") vaultConfig.liquidationRatio = uint64(data);
    else if (parameter == "liquidationPenalty") liquidationConfig.liquidationPenalty = uint64(data);
    else if (parameter == "liquidationDiscount") liquidationConfig.liquidationDiscount = uint64(data);
    else revert CDPVault__setParameter_unrecognizedParameter();
    emit SetParameter(parameter, data);
}

function setParameter(bytes32 parameter, address data) external whenNotPaused onlyRole(VAULT_CONFIG_ROLE) {
    if (parameter == "rewardController") rewardController = IChefIncentivesController(data);
    else revert CDPVault__setParameter_unrecognizedParameter();
    emit SetParameter(parameter, data);
}
```

- **Deposit**: Function to manage user collateral deposits.
```bash
function deposit(address to, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 tokenAmount) {
    tokenAmount = wdiv(amount, tokenScale);
    int256 deltaCollateral = toInt256(tokenAmount);
    modifyCollateralAndDebt({
        owner: to,
        collateralizer: msg.sender,
        creditor: msg.sender,
        deltaCollateral: deltaCollateral,
        deltaDebt: 0
    });
}
```
The deposit function:
- Converts input amount to proper scale
- Creates a positive delta for collateral
- No change in debt
- Uses the core modifyCollateralAndDebt function

- **Withdrawal**: Function to manage user collateral withdrawals.
```bash
function withdraw(address to, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused returns (uint256 tokenAmount) {
    tokenAmount = wdiv(amount, tokenScale);
    int256 deltaCollateral = -toInt256(tokenAmount);
    modifyCollateralAndDebt({
        owner: to,
        collateralizer: msg.sender,
        creditor: msg.sender,
        deltaCollateral: deltaCollateral,
        deltaDebt: 0
    });
}
```

- **Borrow/Repay**: Functions that allow users to borrow against their collateral and repay debts. The functions take the address of the borrower, address of the position and the amount to borrow or repay.
```bash
function borrow(address borrower, address position, uint256 amount) external {
    int256 deltaDebt = toInt256(amount);
    modifyCollateralAndDebt({
        owner: position,
        collateralizer: position,
        creditor: borrower,
        deltaCollateral: 0,
        deltaDebt: deltaDebt
    });
}

function repay(address borrower, address position, uint256 amount) external {
    int256 deltaDebt = -toInt256(amount);
    modifyCollateralAndDebt({
        owner: position,
        collateralizer: position,
        creditor: borrower,
        deltaCollateral: 0,
        deltaDebt: deltaDebt
    });
}
```
- **spotPrice**: Implements oracle functionality to get the price of the collateral token.
```bash
function spotPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
    return oracle.spot(address(token));
}
```
- **_modifyPosition**: An internal function used in the core modifyCollateralAndDebt function to make changes to a users position on depositing, withdrawing, borrowing, repaying and so on. 
```bash
function _modifyPosition(
    address owner,
    Position memory position,
    uint256 newDebt,
    uint256 newCumulativeIndex,
    int256 deltaCollateral,
    uint256 totalDebt_
) internal returns (Position memory) {
uint256 currentDebt = position.debt;
// update collateral and debt amounts by the deltas
position.collateral = add(position.collateral, deltaCollateral);
position.debt = newDebt; // U:[CM-10,11]
position.cumulativeIndexLastUpdate = newCumulativeIndex; // U:[CM-10,11]
position.lastDebtUpdate = uint64(block.number); // U:[CM-10,11]

// position either has no debt or more debt than the debt floor
if (position.debt != 0 && position.debt < uint256(vaultConfig.debtFloor))
    revert CDPVault__modifyPosition_debtFloor();

// store the position's balances
positions[owner] = position;

// update the global debt balance
if (newDebt > currentDebt) {
    totalDebt_ = totalDebt_ + (newDebt - currentDebt);
} else {
    totalDebt_ = totalDebt_ - (currentDebt - newDebt);
}
totalDebt = totalDebt_;

if (address(rewardController) != address(0)) {
    rewardController.handleActionAfter(owner, position.debt, totalDebt_);
}

emit ModifyPosition(owner, position.debt, position.collateral, totalDebt_);

return position;
}
```
- **_isCollateralized**: An internal function used to check if the collateral value is equal to or greater than the debt. Makes sure users don't borrow too much against their collateral
```bash
function _isCollateralized(
uint256 debt,
uint256 collateralValue,
uint256 liquidationRatio
) internal pure returns (bool) {
return (wdiv(collateralValue, liquidationRatio) >= debt);
}
```
- **modifyCollateralAndDebt**: This is the central function for managing CDP positions. It handles both collateral and debt modifications in a single transaction. It uses safe transfer methods to move tokens, updates interest accumulators, emits events for tracking, and enforces position safety checks.
```bash
function modifyCollateralAndDebt(
    address owner,
    address collateralizer,
    address creditor,
    int256 deltaCollateral,
    int256 deltaDebt
) public {
    if (
        // position is either more safe than before or msg.sender has the permission from the owner
        ((deltaDebt > 0 || deltaCollateral < 0) && !hasPermission(owner, msg.sender)) ||
        // msg.sender has the permission of the collateralizer to collateralize the position using their cash
        (deltaCollateral > 0 && !hasPermission(collateralizer, msg.sender)) ||
        // msg.sender has the permission of the creditor to use their credit to repay the debt
        (deltaDebt < 0 && !hasPermission(creditor, msg.sender))
    ) revert CDPVault__modifyCollateralAndDebt_noPermission();

    Position memory position = positions[owner];
    DebtData memory debtData = _calcDebt(position);

    uint256 newDebt;
    uint256 newCumulativeIndex;

    uint256 profit;
    int256 quotaRevenueChange;
    if (deltaDebt > 0) {
        (newDebt, newCumulativeIndex) = CreditLogic.calcIncrease(
            uint256(deltaDebt), // delta debt
            position.debt,
            debtData.cumulativeIndexNow, // current cumulative base interest index in Ray
            position.cumulativeIndexLastUpdate
        ); // U:[CM-10]
        position.cumulativeQuotaInterest = debtData.cumulativeQuotaInterest;
        position.cumulativeQuotaIndexLU = debtData.cumulativeQuotaIndexNow;
        quotaRevenueChange = _calcQuotaRevenueChange(deltaDebt);
        pool.lendCreditAccount(uint256(deltaDebt), creditor); // F:[CM-20]
    } else if (deltaDebt < 0) {
        uint256 maxRepayment = calcTotalDebt(debtData);
        uint256 amount = abs(deltaDebt);
        if (amount >= maxRepayment) {
            amount = maxRepayment; // U:[CM-11]
            deltaDebt = -toInt256(maxRepayment);
        }

        poolUnderlying.safeTransferFrom(creditor, address(pool), amount);

        uint128 newCumulativeQuotaInterest;

```
- **_calcQuotaRevenueChange**: Calculates changes in additional fees based on special rules or limits.
```bash
function _calcQuotaRevenueChange(int256 deltaDebt) internal view returns (int256 quotaRevenueChange) {
    uint16 rate = IPoolQuotaKeeperV3(poolQuotaKeeper()).getQuotaRate(address(token));
    return QuotasLogic.calcQuotaRevenueChange(rate, deltaDebt);
}
```
- **_calcDebt**: Takes a Position struct as input and gets the current interest rate index from the lending pool (this index typically increases over time, representing accumulated interest), stores current and last interest rate indices, calculates quota and preserves quota index from last update. It returns a DebtData struct (cdd = Current Debt Data)
```bash
function _calcDebt(Position memory position) internal view returns (DebtData memory cdd) {
    uint256 index = pool.baseInterestIndex();
    cdd.debt = position.debt;
    cdd.cumulativeIndexNow = index;

    cdd.accruedInterest += cdd.cumulativeQuotaInterest;
}
```
- **_getQuotedTokensData**: Calculates extra interest based on quota rules. It takes three parameters: Current debt, current quota index, and last quota index when the position was updated.
```bash
function _getQuotedTokensData(
    DebtData memory cdd
) internal view returns (uint128 outstandingQuotaInterest, uint192 cumulativeQuotaIndexNow) {

        cdd.cumulativeQuotaIndexLU
    );

    outstandingQuotaInterest = outstandingInterestDelta; // U:[CM-24]
}
```
- **liquidatePosition**: Validates that the position is unsafe by checking if collateral value is below liquidation ratio, calculates collateral to take based on repayment amount and discounted price, applies liquidation penalty to the repayment amount, updates position state (reduces collateral by taken amount, reduces debt by repayment amount, updates interest indices) and transfers: Collateral to liquidator, repayment minus penalty to pool, penalty to treasury.
```bash

}
```
- **liquidatePositionBadDebt**: Requires position's debt to exceed collateral value at discounted price. It takes all remaining collateral, calculates maximum possible repayment based on collateral value, records remaining debt as loss, updates position state completely (zeroes out).
```bash
function liquidatePositionBadDebt(address owner, uint256 repayAmount) external whenNotPaused {

        -toInt256(takeCollateral),
        totalDebt
    );

        IPoolV3(pool).updateQuotaRevenue(quotaRevenueChange); // U:[PQK-15]
    }
}
```
- **calcDecrease**: Calculates how a repayment amount should be distributed between debt reduction and profit (interest). It first handles any accumulated quota interest, where if the repayment amount is sufficient, it pays off the quota interest in full, otherwise it pays what it can. Then, it processes any regular interest accrued on the debt using a cumulative index system, again either paying it fully if possible or partially if not. The remaining amount after interest payments goes toward reducing the principal debt. The function returns the new debt amount, an updated cumulative index, the profit (interest) collected, and the new cumulative quota interest balance.
```bash
function calcDecrease(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 debt,
    uint256 cumulativeIndexNow,
    uint256 cumulativeIndexLastUpdate,
    uint128 cumulativeQuotaInterest
)
    internal
    pure
    returns (uint256 newDebt, uint256 newCumulativeIndex, uint256 profit, uint128 newCumulativeQuotaInterest)
{
    uint256 amountToRepay = amount;

    if (cumulativeQuotaInterest != 0 && amountToRepay != 0) {
        // All interest accrued on the quota interest is taken by the DAO to be distributed to LP stakers, dLP stakers and the DAO

        if (amountToRepay >= cumulativeQuotaInterest) {
            amountToRepay -= cumulativeQuotaInterest; // U:[CL-3]
            profit += cumulativeQuotaInterest; // U:[CL-3]

            newCumulativeQuotaInterest = 0; // U:[CL-3]
        } else {
            // If amount is not enough to repay quota interest + DAO fee, then send all to the stakers
            uint256 quotaInterestPaid = amountToRepay; // U:[CL-3]
            profit += amountToRepay; // U:[CL-3]
            amountToRepay = 0; // U:[CL-3]

            newCumulativeQuotaInterest = uint128(cumulativeQuotaInterest - quotaInterestPaid); // U:[CL-3]
        }
    } else {
        newCumulativeQuotaInterest = cumulativeQuotaInterest;
    }

    if (amountToRepay != 0) {
        uint256 interestAccrued = CreditLogic.calcAccruedInterest({
            amount: debt,
            cumulativeIndexLastUpdate: cumulativeIndexLastUpdate,
            cumulativeIndexNow: cumulativeIndexNow
        });
        // All interest accrued on the base interest is taken by the DAO to be distributed to LP stakers, dLP stakers and the DAO
        if (amountToRepay >= interestAccrued) {
            amountToRepay -= interestAccrued;

            profit += interestAccrued;

            newCumulativeIndex = cumulativeIndexNow;
        } else {
            // If amount is not enough to repay interest, then send all to the stakers and update index
            profit += amountToRepay; // U:[CL-3]
            amountToRepay = 0; // U:[CL-3]

            newCumulativeIndex =
                (INDEX_PRECISION * cumulativeIndexNow * cumulativeIndexLastUpdate) /
                (INDEX_PRECISION *
                    cumulativeIndexNow -
                    (INDEX_PRECISION * profit * cumulativeIndexLastUpdate) /
                    debt); // U:[CL-3]
        }
    } else {
        newCumulativeIndex = cumulativeIndexLastUpdate;
    }
    newDebt = debt - amountToRepay;
}
```
- **calcAccruedInterest**: This function calculates the interest accrued on a loan amount by comparing two cumulative interest rate indices (from the last update and current time). It uses a simple formula where it multiplies the principal amount by the current index, divides by the previous index, and subtracts the original amount to get the interest earned. If the principal amount is zero, it returns zero to avoid unnecessary calculations.
```bash
function calcAccruedInterest(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 cumulativeIndexLastUpdate,
    uint256 cumulativeIndexNow
) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (amount == 0) return 0;
    return (amount * cumulativeIndexNow) / cumulativeIndexLastUpdate - amount;
}
```
- **virtualDebt**: This function calculates the actual ('virtual') debt for a given position address by first getting the raw debt value from the positions mapping, then applying any necessary debt calculations through _calcDebt and calcTotalDebt functions to determine the true outstanding debt amount, including accrued interest and fees.
```bash
function virtualDebt(address position) external view returns (uint256) {
    return calcTotalDebt(_calcDebt(positions[position]));
}
```
- **calcTotalDebt**: Calculates the total debt by simply adding the base debt amount with any accrued interest from the DebtData struct.
```bash
function calcTotalDebt(DebtData memory debtData) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return debtData.debt + debtData.accruedInterest; //+ debtData.accruedFees;
}
```
- **poolQuotaKeeper**: This function retrieves the address of the quota keeper connected to the pool by calling the poolQuotaKeeper() function on a pool contract. The pool address is stored in a state variable called 'pool'.
```bash
function poolQuotaKeeper() public view returns (address) {
    return IPoolV3(pool).poolQuotaKeeper(); // U:[CM-47]
}
```
- **quotasInterest**: Retrieves the accumulated quota interest for a specific position address by first calculating the current debt data through _calcDebt (using the position's stored data), then returning just the cumulativeQuotaInterest value from the resulting DebtData struct.
```bash
function quotasInterest(address position) external view returns (uint256) {
    DebtData memory debtData = _calcDebt(positions[position]);
    return debtData.cumulativeQuotaInterest;
}
```
- **getDebtData**: Returns the complete DebtData struct for a given position address by calculating the current debt state using _calcDebt on the position's stored data.
```bash
function getDebtData(address position) external view returns (DebtData memory) {
    return _calcDebt(positions[position]);
}
```
- **getDebtInfo**: This function is similar to getDebtData but instead of returning the entire DebtData struct, it specifically returns three values from it: the base debt amount, accrued interest, and cumulative quota interest for a given position address. It's essentially a more specific version that destructures the key values from the DebtData struct after calculating the current debt state.
```bash
function getDebtInfo(
    address position
) external view returns (uint256 debt, uint256 accruedInterest, uint256 cumulativeQuotaInterest) {
    DebtData memory debtData = _calcDebt(positions[position]);
    return (debtData.debt, debtData.accruedInterest, debtData.cumulativeQuotaInterest);
}
```
